#This is a list of things that EMF-Fragments current cannot deal with.

# Open Points #

This is a list of issues that might be hard or impossible to solve. This represents EMF-Fragments short comings, and these things are therefore not classified as actual issues (i.e. things that can be solved).

  * If a fragment is removed all "contained" fragments are not removed.
  * If a object is removed from the model, all cross references break.
